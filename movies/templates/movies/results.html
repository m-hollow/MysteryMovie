<!-- you should create the UserRoundDetail object whenever a Round gets created and whenever
    a round gets modified...but in the case of 'modified', how will you know which users are 'new'
    to create now? You do NOT want to re-create all users, as this will 'initialize' their 
    attributes, which would be bad: what if a user joins 'in progress': adding them would reset
    all other users..... -->

<!-- Here in Results, and/or in Admin Panel page, do this:

    Movie Title
    The following users have submitted their details for this movie:   username, username...
    The following users still need to submit their details for this movie:   username, username...
